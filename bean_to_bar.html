            <p class="intro">
                Every chocolate bar begins its journey far from the shop shelves — with the humble cocoa bean grown in
                tropical regions on small farms. Turning those beans into the delicious chocolate we know involves many
                careful steps, each contributing to the flavour, texture, and quality of the final product.

            <section class="journey-steps">
                <div>
                    <h2>Growing Cocoa Beans</h2>
                    <p>Cocoa trees thrive in hot, humid climates near the equator. They are usually tended by
                        smallholder farmers in countries like Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, Ecuador, and Indonesia. These trees
                        produce pods throughout the year, and good agricultural care — including pruning, weeding, and
                        pest control — is essential to healthy growth and future yields.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h2>Harvesting and Pod Breaking</h2>
                    <p>Once the cocoa pods are ripe, farmers harvest them by hand. Pods are then opened to extract the
                        wet beans inside. This part of the process must happen regularly during the harvest season
                        because the pods do not all mature at the same time.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h2>Fermentation and Drying</h2>
                    <p>After harvesting, the beans and their surrounding pulp are placed in piles and covered, where
                        they ferment for several days. Fermentation is vital — it develops rich flavours and reduces
                        bitterness. Afterward, the beans are dried in the sun for several more days to stop fermentation
                        and make them suitable for storage and transport.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h2>Sourcing, Cleaning, and Shipping</h2>
                    <p>Once dried, the beans are cleaned, packed, and sold to buyers or cooperatives. They may be graded
                        and stored near ports before being shipped to chocolate manufacturers. How beans move through
                        the supply chain can vary, but careful handling helps maintain quality and traceability.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h2>Roasting and Grinding</h2>
                    <p>At the chocolate makers facility, the beans are roasted to deepen their flavour and develop
                        aroma.
                        Roasting conditions are adjusted depending on the variety and desired taste profile. The roasted
                        beans are then cracked open and winnowed to remove the shells, leaving behind cocoa nibs. These
                        nibs
                        are ground into a smooth paste known as chocolate liquor, which forms the base of all chocolate
                        products.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h2>Conching and Refining</h2>
                    <p>The chocolate liquor is further processed with other ingredients such as sugar, vanilla, and milk
                        (for milk chocolate). It is refined and conched — a process that smooths texture and develops
                        flavour through extended mixing under heat. This step is essential for achieving the
                        characteristic
                        richness and consistency of quality chocolate.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h2>Tempering and Molding</h2>
                    <p>Once refined, the chocolate is tempered by carefully controlling temperature to create stable
                        crystals. This gives the finished bar its glossy surface and desirable snap. The tempered
                        chocolate
                        is then poured into molds and cooled to set into bars, bonbons, or other forms.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h2>Packaging and Retail</h2>
                    <p>Finally, the finished chocolate is wrapped, packaged, and shipped to stores or sold online, ready
                        for chocolate lovers to enjoy. Whether dark, milk, or white chocolate, each bar reflects a long
                        journey from the cocoa farms to your hands.</p>
