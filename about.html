            <section>
                Death by Chocolate is a small artisan chocolate business founded on a passion for crafting chocolate
                with care, patience, and purpose. What began as a love for experimenting with cocoa has grown into a
                dedication to producing chocolate that celebrates quality over quantity.
                We create our chocolate in small batches, allowing us to stay closely involved in every stage of the
                process — from carefully selecting ethically sourced cocoa beans to refining, tempering, and moulding
                each bar by hand. This hands-on approach ensures consistency, depth of flavour, and a level of
                craftsmanship that mass-produced chocolate simply cannot achieve.
                Our focus is on thoughtful indulgence. We believe great chocolate should be savoured, not rushed, and
                that its flavour should reflect the time and skill invested in its creation. By working on a small
                scale, we can experiment with textures and flavour combinations while maintaining the highest standards
                of quality.
                At Death by Chocolate, we value transparency, sustainability, and respect for the origins of our
                ingredients. Every bar we produce tells a story of careful sourcing, skilled craftsmanship, and a
                genuine love for chocolate — from bean to bar.
