## Design

### Color Scheme

| Use                  | Colour           | Hex       | Why                                         |
| -------------------- | ---------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Primary Brown   | Deep Cocoa Brown | `#251109` | Feels rich, premium, and chocolate-inspired |
| Secondary Brown | Warm Cream       | `#F6EFEA` | Soft contrast, improves readability         |
| Accent / CTA         | Burnt Gold       | `#C9A14A` | Luxury, highlights buttons and prices       |

### Typography

The typography combines expressive branding with a light, elegant text style to reflect the handcrafted and artisanal nature of the brand. A limited font palette is used to maintain visual consistency while ensuring readability and a distinctive identity.

***Babylonica*** is used exclusively for the logo to create a unique and expressive brand identity. Its flowing, handwritten style conveys craftsmanship, creativity, and individuality, reinforcing the artisan quality of the chocolate company while remaining visually memorable.

***Poiret One*** is used across the website for navigation, headings, and body text. In bold weights, it provides clear structure and emphasis for headings and navigation elements, while a medium weight is used for body text to maintain readability. Its light, refined letterforms contribute to a modern and minimalist aesthetic that complements the premium, handcrafted chocolate theme.

## Semantic HTML5 elements:

<code>header</code>

<code>nav</code>

<code>section</code>

<code>footer</code>

## Interactivity & Animation

***CSS transitions:***

- Buttons

## Accessibility & Usability Considerations

Poiret One is used consistently across the website with careful adjustments to font weight, size, and spacing to maintain readability and accessibility. Bold weights are applied to navigation and headings to establish a clear visual hierarchy, while a medium weight is used for body text to improve legibility during longer reading.

Line height and spacing are increased to reduce visual strain, and sufficient colour contrast is maintained between text and background to ensure content remains readable for users with visual impairments. Decorative typography is limited to branding elements only, preventing distraction and supporting a clear, user-friendly experience across different devices and screen sizes.

- High contrast text for readability

- Clear navigation menu

- Alt text for all images

- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
