## Design

### Color Scheme

| Use                  | Colour           | Hex       | Why                                         |
| -------------------- | ---------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Primary Background   | Deep Cocoa Brown | `#3B1F14` | Feels rich, premium, and chocolate-inspired |

| Accent / CTA         | Burnt Gold       | `#C9A14A` | Luxury, highlights buttons and prices       |

### Typography

The typography combines decorative and modern fonts to balance brand personality with usability, using Babylonica for expressive branding, Montserrat for clarity and structure, and Poiret One for elegant text.

***Babylonica*** is used exclusively for the logo to create a distinctive and expressive brand identity. Its flowing, handwritten style conveys craftsmanship, creativity, and individuality, reinforcing the artisan nature of the chocolate company while remaining visually memorable.

***Montserrat*** is used for navigation elements and headings because of its strong readability and contemporary structure. Its clear, geometric design ensures easy scanning of content, supports accessibility, and provides visual contrast against the more decorative body and logo fonts.

***Poiret One*** is used for body text due to its light, elegant appearance, which enhances the refined and artisanal tone of the website. Its clean letterforms maintain readability while contributing to a modern and minimal aesthetic that complements the handcrafted chocolate theme.
